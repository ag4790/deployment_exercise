---CREATING THE JAR FILE WITH THE SCRIPT---
First, ensure that you have Java 16.0.2 or higher installed. You can check which version you have by typing "java --version" on the command line. If you don't have Java 16.0.2, you can download it from the
Oracle website. You will also need to download and install Git Bash if you do not have it. This can be downloaded from the Git website at git-scm.com.

In order to create the JAR file, clone the Github repository into your computer. Start by opening Git Bash and typing "git clone https://github.com/ag4790/deployment_exercise". Now that the repository has been cloned, enter it using "cd deployment_exercise". Now run the convenient script provided for you with "sh buildJar.sh" to create the JAR.

---CREATING THE JAR FILE MANUALLY---
If you don't want to use the script and instead want to create the JAR file yourself, start by cloning the repository and entering it like above. Now, use "./gradlew build" to ensure that you're starting with
a successful build. Extract the needed folder from the log4j JAR in the base level of the repository with "jar xf log4j-api-2.13.3.jar org". Move it into the classes folder in order to create the proper 
directory structure for the JAR using "mv org build/classes/java/main". Now change to that directory with "cd build/classes/java/main". Create the JAR file with "jar cfe RunEdgeConvert.jar RunEdgeConvert ./*".
Now you should clean up the classes folder by deleting the org folder with "rm org -r" and moving the JAR outside with "mv RunEdgeConvert.jar ../../../..". Now you can learn how to run the JAR by reading
the README.txt.
