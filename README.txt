---REQUIRED INSTALLATIONS---
In order to use the JAR file, you must have Java 16.0.2 or higher installed. You can check if it is installed by typing "java --version" on the command line. If it is not installed, you can download it from 
the Oracle website.

No other installations are required for running the JAR file.

---RUNNING THE JAR---
Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory that you have stored the JAR file in. Type the command "java -jar RunEdgeConvert.jar" in order to run the program.

Upon running, an error message will warn you about not having a logging implementation. This is fine and you can ignore this.
